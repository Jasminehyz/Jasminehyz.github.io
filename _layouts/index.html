                <p>Welcome to my digital corner of the world! I'm an Angular devotee with a solid 5-year track record. 

On the backend, I've mastered both the .NET and Node.js ecosystems. My full-stack prowess allows me to seamlessly bridge frontend and backend, ensuring optimal performance and seamless integration.

But there's more to me than code! I'm an also reader and writer, immersing myself in diverse books to broaden my perspectives and inform my work. Writing is my creative outlet, and I delight in sharing my tech expertise through tutorials, opinions, and thought leadership articles, fostering a community of knowledge exchange. 

<p>In essence, I'm Yuanzhen: an Angular expert with 5 years under my belt, a .NET and Node.js full-stack pro, a wordsmith, and a passionate creator. If you're seeking a seasoned engineer to elevate your project, a skilled writer to contribute compelling content, or a collaborative innovator to bring your vision to life across the Angular/.NET/Node.js stack, let's connect and harness the power of technology together!</p>
